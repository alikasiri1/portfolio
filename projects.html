                ## Overview
                
                This project is developed as a part of the Machine Learning Fundamentals course at the University of Isfahan. The main objective is to build a classification and clustering model for leaf images.

                ## Initial Processing
                
                ### Background Removal and Conversion
                
                Initially, the leaf images had various backgrounds which interfered with image processing. The background was removed using the `rembg` library and converted to a uniform white background.
    
                ## Feature Extraction
                
                Feature extraction is performed using the `feature_extraction.py` script, which includes a class `Images_class` for processing images using `cv2`.
                
                ### Distance Features
                
                The Euclidean distance from the centroid of the leaf to its contour points is calculated and normalized. This helps in identifying leaves with different shapes and petal counts.
                
                ### Leaf Dimensions Features
                
                - **Length to Width Ratio:** Calculated using the bounding rectangle around the leaf.
                - **Leaf to Background Ratio:** The ratio of the leaf area to its bounding rectangle area.
                - **Form Factor:** Measures how similar the shape is to a perfect circle.
                - **Convexity:** Ratio of the perimeter of the shape to its convex hull.
                - **Perimeter:** Length of the contour defining the leaf.
                
                ### Leaf Color Features
                
                Mean color values for red, green, and blue channels are calculated and stored.
                
                ### HOG Features
                
                Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) features are extracted using the `hog` function from `skimage.feature`.
                
                ### Feature Extraction with RESNET-50
                
                Features are extracted from images using a pre-trained ResNet-50 model.
                
                ## Leaf Classification
                
                ### Data Preprocessing
                
                The dataset is split into training and testing sets, and features are scaled.
                
                ### Model Selection
                
                Various classifiers are tested, including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, etc. Logistic Regression performed the best.
                
                ### Model Training
                
                Logistic Regression is selected for final training.
                
                ### Model Evaluation
                
                The model is evaluated using a 25-fold cross-validation, achieving an average accuracy of 93.29%.
                
                ## Leaf Clustering
                
                ### Feature Selection and Normalization
                
                All relevant features are selected and normalized for clustering.
                
                ### Dimensionality Reduction
                
                T-SNE is used for dimensionality reduction to two dimensions.
                
                ### Model Evaluation Metrics
                
                Silhouette score and Dunn index are used to evaluate the clustering models.
                
                ### Clustering Model Selection
                
                Models like K-Means, Spectral Clustering, and Agglomerative Clustering are tested, and the best model is selected based on evaluation metrics.
